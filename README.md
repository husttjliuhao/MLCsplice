# MLCsplice
Predicting nonclassical splice variants effect on splicing

MLCsplice is a hybrid model based on splicing region-specific, which integrated the best machine learning algorithm from five splicing regions including the exonic region (nucleotides at the first and last three sites of an exon), core donor region (+3 to +6 at the donor splice sites), extend donor region (+7 to +13 at the donor splice sites), core accept region (–3 to –12 at the acceptor splice sites), and extend accept region (–13 to –50 at the acceptor splice sites).

The web server, MLCsplice (http://39.105.51.3:8090/MLCsplice/), is publicly available for the community-wide prediction of disease-associated splice variants.
